		<h2>About our mission: </h2>
		<p>As stated in our motto, our goal is to revive traditional 
			conversations in a world overwhelmed by the mindless 
			swipe-and-scroll culture. We're confident that you've 
			grown up witnessing romantic comedies featuring serendipitous 
			encounters between the main characters, and we bet you've 
			envisioned yourself in such scenarios too! 
		</p>
		<p>We're also sure that you've experienced situations where 
			you've wanted to strike up a conversation with someone 
			due to shared interests, perhaps because they're sporting 
			a 'wubba lubba dub dub' T-shirt or because you're both 
			die-hard Ferrari F1 fans :p.
		</p>	
		<p>	That's why we've taken the initiative to create a platform 
			that facilitates these very conversations! 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our motto, in a single line, is to bring back old-school 
			conversations between people at the advent of technology.
		</p>

		<h2>About our vision: </h2>
		<p>
			Our vision is straightforward: We aim to create a world 
			where if two individuals wish to engage in a conversation, 
			they can do so without constantly worrying about the countless 
			obstacles that might hinder their interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			For instance, imagine spotting someone you'd like to 
			converse with at a concert, the airport, or a cute caf√©. 
			Our aim is to ensure that you can approach them without 
			pondering whether they share your desire to engage in conversation;
		</p>
		<p>
			We've got that issue covered for you.
